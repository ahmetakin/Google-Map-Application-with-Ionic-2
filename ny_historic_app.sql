The French built Fort St. Frederic here between 1734 and 1737 and used it as a base for raids on British settlements in New York and New England. As a result, the British mounted various expeditions to take control of Crown Point, and in 1759 they were finally successful. They immediately began construction of new fortifications that they called "His Majesty''s Fort of Crown Point". Enclosing over seven acres this was one of the largest built by the British in North America.  In 1775, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the American colonists captured the fort and secured sorely needed cannons and heavy ordnance. Crown Point was occupied by General John Burgoyne''s army in 1777 after the American evacuation to Mount Independence and remained under British control until the end of the war. The ruins of Fort St. Frederic, "His Majesty''s Fort of Crown Point," and surrounding lands were acquired by the State of New York in 1910.  Today, visitors can explore the preserved ruins of these forts and tour the museum which includes a multimedia orientation program, large scale models, and an exhibit of original artifacts recovered from the site by archaeologists.

The last resting place of this famous literary naturalist overlooks a quiet field surrounded by magnificent views of the Catskill Mountains where he made his home and was first inspired by the unspoiled beauties of the woods, fields, and mountains.  John Burroughs, the celebrated naturalist whose 27 books of nature and philosophical essays influenced millions of readers, was born April 3, 1837 on the family''s homestead in Roxbury, Delaware County, NY. There he learned the rhythms of nature and the connections between all living things, lessons that shaped his career as a literary naturalist.  Much of his adult life was spent on a small farm overlooking the Hudson River in West Park, Ulster County where he grew grapes, and celery while perfecting the art of the nature essay. His work appeared in Harper''s, Scribner''s, Atlantic Monthly and other magazines of the day, opening the eyes of his 19th- and 20th-century contemporaries to the wonders of the natural world right outside their doors.  His essays were collected in books that sold more than a million and a half copies in his lifetime and were required reading in schools across the country. He became a respected friend of such luminaries as novelist Hamlin Garland and Ida Tarbell, industrialists Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison; and political leaders including Teddy Roosevelt, who wrote of Burroughs, "It is a good thing for our people that you should have lived."  In 1899 he served as the historian on the Harriman Expedition exploring the coast of Alaska with conservationist John Muir, painter Louis Agassiz, photographer Edward Curtis and a host of scientists.  But always his heart remained in the Catskills. "Those hills comfort me as no other place in the world," he wrote. And so, in 1910, Burroughs returned to the comfort of the family farm to spend summers in a little farmhouse he named Woodchuck Lodge. There he continued to write in a hay barn up the road, and there he entertained neighbors and luminaries alike.  While he was not a strict conservationist or an environmental activist, his message of land stewardship and his quiet warnings about the potential impact of unchecked development and resource consumption resonate today.  John Burroughs died March 29, 1921. He was buried on his 84th birthday in what is now Burroughs Memorial Field, a state historic site just up the road from Woodchuck Lodge and within a mile of the farmstead where he was raised.

The Hall of Honor is located here to commemorate the awarding of the Purple Heart to 137 local World War I veterans on these grounds in 1932. The Purple Heart is awarded only to those who have been killed or wounded by enemy action and is America''s oldest military decoration.  The Hall of Honor is the first in the nation dedicated to commemorating the sacrifices of the more than 1.8 million recipients of this award. The mission of the Hall of Honor is to collect, preserve and share the stories of Purple Heart recipients from all branches of service and across all conflicts for which the award has been available. One way their history and stories are preserved is through the Roll of Honor, an electronic database where visitors can search for Purple Heart recipients, or view a changing selection of Featured Recipients.  As there is no comprehensive list of Purple Heart recipients in existence, the Roll of Honor here is an effort to develop as comprehensive a list as possible. Enrollments are voluntary, and come from recipients, their families or friends. Visitors who are recipients, or who know of recipients are encouraged to enroll in the Roll of Honor. Information on enrollment can be obtained by contacting the Hall.  The Roll consists of approximately 10% of the estimated total number of awards. However, it has considerable depth and breadth, representing all fifty states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa and the Philippines. The Roll of Honor also contains the names of recipients who have served from the Civil War to today.  The gallery exhibits begin by taking visitors through a visual timeline of America''s 20th and 21st century conflicts. There is a Timeline Interactive touchscreen which provides information on conflicts from the Civil War through Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), which represents the range of conflicts for which the Purple Heart has been available.', '374 Temple Hill Road Route 300 New Windsor, NY 12584', '', '(845) 561-1765'),

Prominent among the signatures was that of Frederick Philipse III, Lord of the vast Manor of Philipsburg and resident of the elegant mansion known today as Philipse Manor Hall. Frederick Philipse III and his family lived in luxury, well supported by rents from the many tenant farms on his property. Times were changing, however, and while others rebelled against Great Britain, Frederick III defended the Crown. His Loyalist beliefs were so strong that General George Washington ordered him arrested in 1776. Philipse and his family later fled to British occupied New York City and then to England, where the last "Lord of the Manor", broken in spirit and health, died in 1786. His land and his mansion were confiscated by the New York State Legislature and sold at public auction.

In 1890, Ruth Livingston Mills inherited her childhood home and property which had once belonged to her great-grandfather, Morgan Lewis, the third governor of New York State.    In the 1890s Mr. & Mrs. Mills commissioned the prestigious New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White to remodel and enlarge their home.
